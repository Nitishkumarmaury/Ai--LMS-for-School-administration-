# 🔍 Debug Parent Dashboard - Zero Data Issue

## Quick Steps

1. **Open Browser Console** (Press F12)
2. **Login as parent** at http://localhost:3001/parent-login  
3. **Check console for these key messages:**

```
✅ Parent authenticated: parent@email.com
🔍 [Quiz] Documents found: 2
🔍 [Marks] Documents found: 3
🔍 [Attendance] Documents found: 15
```

4. **If you see "Documents found: 0"** - Student has no data (add quizzes, marks, attendance first)
5. **If you see "permission-denied"** - Parent needs to re-signup with new Firebase Auth system

## Most Likely Fix

**Old parent accounts won't work!** They need to:
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/parent-login
2. Click "Sign Up"  
3. Re-register with same info
4. This creates Firebase Auth credentials
5. Now data will load!
