**New URL:**
```
http://localhost:3004/teacher-login
```

## 🧪 How to Test Email Update:

### Step 1: Open Firebase Console
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select project: `my-login-app-8a4fa`
3. Click **Firestore Database**
4. Click **Rules** tab
5. Make sure these rules are published:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /teachers/{teacherId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == teacherId;
    }
    match /attendance/{attendanceId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /emailNotifications/{emailId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
    match /studentEmails/{studentId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

6. Click **Publish** if not already published

### Step 2: Test in Browser

1. **Open the app:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3004/teacher-login
   ```

2. **Login:**
   - Access Code: `TEACH2024003`
   - Your teacher email/password

3. **Open Browser Console** (F12) to see logs

4. **Edit an email:**
   - Select Class 9A
   - Find "Arjun Verma" (Roll 001)
   - Click **Edit** button
   - Change email to: `test123@example.com`
   - Click **Save**

5. **Check Console Logs:**
   You should see:
   ```
   Updating email for student: 9 to: test123@example.com
   ✅ Email saved to Firestore successfully!
   ```

6. **Check Success Message:**
   - Green message should appear: "Parent email updated and saved successfully!"

7. **Verify Persistence:**
   - Switch to Class 10A
   - Switch back to Class 9A
   - Arjun's email should still show `test123@example.com`

8. **Verify in Firestore:**
   - Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Data tab
   - Look for collection: `studentEmails`
   - Find document with ID: `9` (Arjun's ID)
   - Should contain:
     ```json
     {
       "studentId": "9",
       "studentName": "Arjun Verma",
       "class": "Class 9A",
       "rollNumber": "001",
       "parentEmail": "test123@example.com",
       "updatedAt": <timestamp>,
       "updatedBy": "your-email@example.com"
     }
     ```

## ❌ Common Errors & Solutions:

### Error 1: "Failed to update parent email: Student not found"
**Cause:** Student ID not found in current students list
**Solution:** Make sure you're on the correct class before editing

### Error 2: "Failed to update parent email: Permission denied"
**Cause:** Firestore rules not configured properly
**Solution:** 
1. Check Firebase Console → Firestore → Rules
2. Make sure `studentEmails` collection has read/write permissions
3. Click **Publish** after updating rules

### Error 3: Email reverts after refresh
**Cause:** Firestore save failed silently
**Solution:**
1. Open Browser Console (F12)
2. Look for red error messages
3. Check if you see: "✅ Email saved to Firestore successfully!"
4. If not, check Firestore rules

### Error 4: "Cannot read properties of null (user.email)"
**Cause:** User object is null
**Solution:** 
- Make sure you're logged in
- The code now uses `user?.email || 'unknown'` as fallback
