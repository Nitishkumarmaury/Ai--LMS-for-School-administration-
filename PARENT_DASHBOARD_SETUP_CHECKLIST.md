## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid roll number. Student not found."
**Solution**: Teacher must add the student first via Teacher Dashboard → Marks tab

### "Parent account already exists"
**Solution**: Use Login instead of Signup. One parent per student.

### Scoreboard shows all zeros
**Possible Causes**:
1. Student hasn't attempted any quizzes yet
2. No marks have been uploaded by teacher
3. No attendance recorded yet

**Solution**: 
- Teacher creates and assigns quizzes
- Student attempts quizzes
- Teacher uploads marks
- Teacher records attendance

### "Invalid credentials"
**Solution**: 
- Check roll number spelling (case-sensitive)
- Verify password is correct
- Try signup if account doesn't exist

### Dashboard not loading
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console (F12) for errors
2. Verify Firestore rules are published
3. Ensure Firebase connection is active
4. Check sessionStorage has parent data

## 📱 Browser Compatibility

✅ **Tested and Working**:
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

⚠️ **Requirements**:
- JavaScript enabled
- sessionStorage enabled
- Internet connection (for Firestore)

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Data Protection
- Passwords stored in Firestore (consider bcrypt for production)
- Session data only in sessionStorage (not localStorage)
- Auto-logout on browser close
- No cross-student data exposure

### Access Control
- Parents can only view their own child's data
- Queries filtered by roll number
- Firestore rules require authentication
- No public access to parent data

### Production Recommendations
1. **Hash passwords**: Use bcrypt or Firebase Auth
2. **Email verification**: Verify parent email before activation
3. **Rate limiting**: Prevent brute force attacks
4. **2FA**: Add two-factor authentication option
5. **Audit logs**: Track parent login/activity
