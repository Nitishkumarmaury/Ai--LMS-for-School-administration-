# 📚 Attendance & Student Management System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The attendance system is now fully integrated with the **Manage Students** feature. Teachers must first add students via roll numbers before marking attendance. This ensures a centralized student database and accurate attendance tracking.

## 🔄 System Workflow

### **Step 1: Teacher Creates Roll Numbers** (Manage Students Tab)
1. Navigate to **"Manage Students"** tab
2. Select a class (e.g., "Class 10A")
3. Add roll numbers with student names:
   - Roll Number: `001`
   - Student Name: `John Doe`
   - Click **"Add Roll Number"**
4. Repeat for all students in the class

### **Step 2: Students Register** (Optional)
1. Students visit the student login page
2. Click **"Sign Up"**
3. Enter:
   - **Name** (must match teacher's name)
   - **Email**
   - **Password**
   - **Class** (select from dropdown)
   - **Roll Number** (must match teacher-assigned roll number)
4. System validates roll number against teacher's database
5. If valid, student account is created and linked to roll number

### **Step 3: Teacher Marks Attendance**
1. Navigate to **"Mark Attendance"** tab
2. Select class
3. System automatically loads students from **Manage Students**:
   - **Registered students**: Shows full name from student account
   - **Unregistered students**: Shows placeholder name from teacher's list
4. Toggle present/absent for each student
5. Click **"Submit Attendance"**
6. System sends email notifications to parents (if configured)

```javascript
{
  id: "auto-generated",
  rollNumber: "001",

  isRegistered: false, // true when student signs up
  registeredStudentId: null, // Firebase Auth UID when registered

## 🔥 Firestore Setup

### **1. Update Firestore Rules**

Copy rules from `FIRESTORE_RULES_COMPLETE.txt` to Firebase Console:

```javascript
// Student Roll Numbers collection
match /studentRollNumbers/{rollNumberId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth != null;
}

// Students collection
match /students/{studentId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
}
```

### **2. Create Required Indexes**

When you first use the features, Firebase will show index creation links. Click them to auto-create indexes.

**Manual Index Creation** (if needed):

#### **Index 1: studentRollNumbers**
- Collection ID: `studentRollNumbers`
- Fields to index:
  1. `class` - Ascending
  2. `rollNumber` - Ascending
- Query scope: Collection

#### **Index 2: attendance (if not created)**
- Collection ID: `attendance`
- Fields to index:
  1. `class` - Ascending
  2. `date` - Descending
- Query scope: Collection

## 🎯 Best Practices

### **1. Roll Number Management**
- ✅ **Add all students at start of year**
- ✅ **Use consistent numbering**: 001, 002, 003... (leading zeros)
- ✅ **Double-check names**: Students must enter exact name during signup
- ❌ **Don't delete roll numbers**: If a student is already registered

### **2. Attendance Marking**
- ✅ **Mark attendance daily**: Builds accurate analytics
- ✅ **Mark at consistent time**: Start of class or end of class
- ✅ **Review before submitting**: Check all toggles
- ❌ **Don't skip days**: Missing days affect percentage calculations

### **3. Student Registration**
- ✅ **Share roll numbers**: Give students their roll numbers
- ✅ **Verify class**: Students must select correct class
- ✅ **Exact name match**: Tell students to use exact name as assigned
- ❌ **No duplicate registrations**: One roll number = one student account

### **4. Parent Emails**
- ✅ **Update emails early**: Edit parent emails in Mark Attendance tab
- ✅ **Use verified emails**: Ensure emails can receive notifications
- ✅ **Test first**: Mark attendance for one student to test email
- ❌ **Don't use unverified domains**: Some email providers block automated emails
