# ✅ Quiz Topic Extraction - Enhanced Fix v2

## 🐛 Problem Identified

**Issue:** AI was generating "General Knowledge" quiz instead of "Trigonometry" quiz

**User Input:** "io want to make quiz subject math chapter trignometroy set 10 question of 5 marks"

**What Went Wrong:**
1. Typo: "trignometroy" instead of "trigonometry"
2. Unusual word order: "subject math chapter trigonometry"
3. Old regex patterns couldn't handle this format
4. Extraction logic failed → defaulted to "General Knowledge"
