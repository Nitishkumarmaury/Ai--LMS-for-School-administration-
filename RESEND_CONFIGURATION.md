## 🚀 **For Production: Add Your Own Domain**

To send to ANY email (not just verified ones), you need to add a custom domain:

### **Option 1: Free Domain Verification (Recommended)**

1. **Buy a domain** (e.g., `yourschool.com` from Namecheap/GoDaddy - ~$10/year)

2. **Add domain to Resend:**
   - Go to: https://resend.com/domains
   - Click **"Add Domain"**
   - Enter: `yourschool.com`

3. **Add DNS Records:**
   - Resend will show you DNS records to add
   - Go to your domain registrar (Namecheap/GoDaddy)
   - Add the DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
   - Wait 24-48 hours for verification

4. **Update Code:**
   ```typescript
   from: 'School Attendance <attendance@yourschool.com>'
   ```

5. **Now you can send to ANY email!** 🎉

### **Option 2: Continue with Test Domain (Free)**

**Current Setup:**
- ✅ Works for testing
- ✅ 100 emails/day free
- ❌ Can only send to verified emails
- ✅ Good enough for development/testing

**To add more recipients:**
1. Go to Resend → Settings → Verified Emails
2. Add each parent email
3. Verify them (they'll get a verification link)
