## 🎯 Real-World Example

### Scenario: Teacher Creates Quiz on "Gravity"

#### AI's Role (Automated):
```javascript
// AI generates this data structure:
{
  title: "Quiz on Gravity",
  subject: "Physics", 
  description: "Test your understanding of gravity concepts",
  totalMarks: 10,
  duration: 15,
  questions: [
    {
      type: 'mcq',
      question: 'What is the acceleration due to gravity on Earth?',
      options: ['9.8 m/s²', '10 m/s²', '8 m/s²', '11 m/s²'],
      correctAnswer: 0,
      points: 2
    },
    // ... 4 more questions
  ]
}

// AI passes this to dashboard
// Form gets pre-filled
// ⚠️ NOT SAVED TO DATABASE YET!
```

#### Teacher's Role (Manual):
```javascript
// 1. Teacher sees pre-filled form
// 2. Teacher thinks: "Hmm, option should be more specific"
// 3. Teacher edits question 1
// 4. Teacher reviews questions 2-5 (looks good!)
// 5. Teacher clicks "Create Quiz" button
// 6. ✅ NOW it saves to database

await addDoc(quizzesRef, {
  // This only happens when teacher clicks button!
  title: "Quiz on Gravity",
  // ... all data
});
```

---

## 🔐 Database Write Control

### What Triggers Database Write?
**ONLY** when teacher clicks "Create Quiz" button:

```typescript
// In TeacherDashboard.tsx
const handleCreateQuiz = async () => {
  // This function is called ONLY when button clicked
  
  try {
    setCreatingQuiz(true);
    
    // ✅ Teacher clicked button - NOW write to database
    const docRef = await addDoc(quizzesRef, {
      title: quizTitle.trim(),
      questions: quizQuestions,
      // ... other fields
    });
    
    setSuccessMessage('Quiz created successfully!');
  } catch (error) {
    setErrorMessage('Failed to create quiz');
  }
};
```

### What Does NOT Trigger Write?
- ❌ AI generating questions
- ❌ Opening the form
- ❌ Pre-filling fields
- ❌ Typing in form fields
- ❌ Clicking "🤖 Create AI Quiz" button
