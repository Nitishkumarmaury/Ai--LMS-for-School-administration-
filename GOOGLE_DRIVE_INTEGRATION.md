# üìÇ Google Drive Integration Guide

## ‚úÖ No Firebase Storage Upgrade Needed!

Since your Firebase region doesn't support free Storage, we've integrated **Google Drive** as an alternative. This is **completely free** and works perfectly for sharing learning materials!

---

## üéØ How It Works

Instead of uploading files directly to Firebase Storage, teachers will:
1. Upload files to **Google Drive** (15GB free)
2. Share the file link
3. Paste the link into the LMS
4. Students can view/download from Google Drive

## üìã Quick Reference

### Supported Link Formats:
The system automatically handles these Google Drive link formats:

1. **File sharing link**:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view
   ```

2. **Open link**:
   ```
   https://drive.google.com/open?id=FILE_ID
   ```

3. **Google Docs/Sheets/Slides**:
   ```
   https://docs.google.com/document/d/FILE_ID/edit
   https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/FILE_ID/edit
   https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/FILE_ID/edit
   ```

The system will automatically extract the file ID and format it correctly!
