---

## 📝 Question Types

### 1️⃣ Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ)

**How it works:**
- 4 options (A, B, C, D)
- Student selects one option via radio button
- Correct answer is stored as index (0-3)

**Example:**
```
Question: "What is the capital of France?"
Options:
  A. London
  B. Paris  ← Correct (index 1)
  C. Berlin
  D. Rome
Points: 2
```

**Grading:**
- Student answer matches correct index → Full points
- Any other selection → 0 points

---

### 2️⃣ True/False Questions

**How it works:**
- Two options: True (index 0) or False (index 1)
- Student clicks one of two large buttons
- Correct answer stored as 0 (True) or 1 (False)

**Example:**
```
Question: "The Earth is flat."
Options: True | False
Correct Answer: False (index 1)
Points: 1
```

**Grading:**
- Student answer matches correct index → Full points
- Wrong selection → 0 points

---

### 3️⃣ Fill-in-the-Blank Questions

**How it works:**
- Student types answer in text input
- Correct answer stored as string
- **Case-insensitive matching** (e.g., "Paris" = "paris" = "PARIS")
- Whitespace trimmed automatically

**Example:**
```
Question: "What is the largest planet in our solar system?"
Correct Answer: "Jupiter"
Points: 3
```

**Grading:**
- `correctAnswer.toLowerCase().trim() === studentAnswer.toLowerCase().trim()` → Full points
- Any mismatch → 0 points

**Important Notes:**
- Spelling must be exact (case-insensitive)
- No partial matching or fuzzy logic
- No support for multiple acceptable answers (yet)

**Cause:** JavaScript timer not initialized  
**Solution:**
