# 🎉 LMS Updated to Use Google Drive!

## ✅ Problem Solved!

Your Firebase region doesn't support free Storage, so I've **updated the LMS to use Google Drive** instead. This is actually **better** for schools!

### Before:
- ❌ Required Firebase Storage (paid Blaze plan)

- 50MB file size limit
- Complex setup

### After:

- Teachers paste Google Drive links
- Files up to 5GB (or unlimited with paid Drive)
- Simple and familiar interface

## 🔒 Firestore Rules (REQUIRED)

You still need to update Firestore rules for the `learningMaterials` collection:

### Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules

Add this rule:

```javascript
// Learning materials collection - For LMS metadata
match /learningMaterials/{materialId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
}
```

**Full rules are in** `FIRESTORE_RULES.md`

## 🎯 What's Stored Where

### Google Drive:
- Actual files (PDFs, videos, documents)
- Your personal or school Drive account
- 15GB free storage

### Firebase Firestore:
- Material metadata only:
  - Title, description, subject
  - Type (PDF/PPT/etc.)
  - Google Drive link
  - Upload date, teacher info
- **No file storage costs!**
