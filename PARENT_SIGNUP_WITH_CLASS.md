## 🔄 How It Works

### Step 1: Student Prerequisites
Before parents can sign up:
1. Teacher assigns a roll number to the student
2. Student registers via Student Login
3. Student is assigned to a class

### Step 2: Parent Signup
1. Navigate to Parent Login page
2. Click "Sign Up" button
3. Fill in the signup form:
   - Parent Name
   - Parent Email
   - Student Roll Number
   - **Student Class** (dropdown selection)
   - Create Password
4. System verifies:
   - Student exists with that roll number
   - Student is actually in the selected class
   - No parent account already exists for this student
5. Account created successfully

### Step 3: Parent Login
1. Enter Student Roll Number
2. Enter Password
3. Access child's progress dashboard

---

## 🔍 Validation Features

### Class Verification
The system verifies that:
- The entered roll number exists in the database
- The student belongs to the class selected by parent
- If mismatch detected, error message shows:
  ```
  Student "[Name]" is registered in class "[Actual Class]", 
  not "[Selected Class]". Please select the correct class.
  ```

### Duplicate Prevention
- Only one parent account allowed per student
- If parent already exists, system prompts to use login instead

### Data Integrity
- Roll number is case-insensitive (automatically converted to uppercase)
- All fields required (cannot be empty)
- Email format validation

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
**File**: `src/pages/ParentLogin.tsx`

**New State**:
```typescript
const [studentClass, setStudentClass] = useState('');
```

**Validation Logic**:
```typescript
// Verify student belongs to the specified class
if (studentData.class !== studentClass) {
  setErrorMessage(
    `Student "${studentData.name}" is registered in class 
    "${studentData.class}", not "${studentClass}". 
    Please select the correct class.`
  );
  return;
}
```

**Parent Data**:
```typescript
const parentData = {
  parentName: parentName.trim(),
  parentEmail: parentEmail.trim(),
  studentRollNumber: rollNumber,
  studentClass: studentClass.trim(),  // ✅ NEW
  password: password,
  studentName: studentData.name,
  createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
};
```

### Database Schema
**Collection**: `parents`

**Required Fields**:
- `parentName`: string
- `parentEmail`: string
- `studentRollNumber`: string
- `studentClass`: string ✅ NEW
- `password`: string
- `studentName`: string
- `createdAt`: timestamp

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Existing Parent Accounts
If you have existing parent accounts without `studentClass`:
1. Parents can still login
2. Class will be fetched from student data
3. Recommend asking parents to update their profile

### Data Consistency
- New signups: Class is mandatory
- Old accounts: Class fetched dynamically from student record
- Both approaches work seamlessly
